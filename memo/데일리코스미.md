### Concept model / Description logic

purpose
	represent clinical information
	retrieve and anlyze health information
	share and integrate data

Concept + Description + Relationship
- Concept: clinical idea with a unique identifier (enable meaning based queries)
	- Code <-> Concept <-> Clnical idea
- Description Fully specified name (FSN) + synonyms
- Relationships: association
	- |is a| relationship: subtype "polyhierarchy"
		- Hierarchy is formed from |is a| relationships
	+ attribute relationship: represent the meaing of the association betwe4en the source and destination concepts
		+ characteristics of the meaning of a concept (e.g. finding site)

##### Concept model
Domain and Range
	Rule: Domain (top level hierarchy) -> Attribute -> Range
ex) clinical finding attributes:
	finding site, associated morphology, associated with, due to, etc...

##### SNOMED CT expression
- structured combination of one or more concept identifiers used to represent a clinical idea in a logical manner, which is automatically processable
- precoordinated expression + postcoordinated expression
	- Right hip joint - example
		- precoordinated: 362906008 | Right hip joint |
		- post-: 182201002 | Hip joint |: 272741003 | Laterality | = 24028007 | Right |

- creating postcordinated expressions: refinement + qualification
	- refinement: refine the value of one or more of the defining attributes of the concept
	- qualification: applying permitted values to the attributes. attributes applied need not be present in the definition of the concept that is being qualified.

- compositional grammar

### Implementation Approaches
- is not all or nothing!
	- simple code system or a powerful terminological resource
	- simpler uses have benefits
	- complete use delivers even more benefits
	- stepwise approach is possible
		- a code system to store clinical information
		- interface terminology
		- indexing system
		- common terminology
		- dictionary
		- extensible foundation

ex 1. Common terminology for communication (with external system)
- health records mapped to SNOMED CT for exchange
- no changes required to core clinical system
ex 2. Common terminology for data integration
- used to integrate multiple data sources, which use different code systems or free text
- provides a consistent representation for combined use
ex 3. Indexing system for retrieval (patient health records -> reporting and analysis OR data extract to DW)
- records may be stored using text or other code systems
- records indexed using SNOMED CT
ex 4. code system for clinical data storage
- SNOMED CT codes stored within clinical data
ex 5. interface terminology for data capture
- terms shown to user come directly from SNOMED CT
- uses local dialect preferred and acceptable synonyms
ex 6. Dictionary for analytics, Dictionary for knowledge base, extensible foundation for clinical data
- uses SNOMED CT's hierarchies & logic definitions
- support querying and aggregation over healt records
- may use ...

##### Terminology binding

### Implementation Use Cases
- Data collection / capture
- Constraining searches
- Rationalizing display of search results
- Data analysis with SNOMED CT
	- enables analysis by any hierarchy and subsumption
	- supports analysis based on defining relationships
	- supports meaningful health records analysis (meaning based data extraction)
- Customization: Reference Set
	- different reference set types suitable to meet specific requirements for use

### Query and Expression Constraint Language

- Executing expression constraints (expression constraint operatiors!)
	- Expression Constraint Language (ECL)
