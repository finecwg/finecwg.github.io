## Travel and Hosting

> Which specific events, activities, or opportunities at HackMIT are you most looking forward to, and why? *

I'm eager to participate in the development of innovative healthcare solutions. Given my research experience in bioinformatics and medical informatics, I'm looking forward to applying my skills to real-world healthcare challenges. I'm particularly interested in projects that involve medical big data, AI applications in healthcare, or the integration of diverse data modalities. This opportunity would allow me to potentially develop impactful solutions in the healthcare sector.

HackMIT provides a unique platform to connect with diverse individuals who are passionate about technology and innovation. I'm excited to engage with fellow participants, mentors, and industry experts from various backgrounds. These interactions will broaden my perspective and potentially lead to collaborative opportunities. This networking can inspire new approaches to healthcare challenges and possibly form connections for future academic or professional collaborations.

## Short answer
> Tell us about your background. How much coding experience do you have, and in what languages, or do you have other skills that you hope to use during the hackathon weekend? *

I have 5+ years of coding experience, primarily in Python and R, which I've applied extensively in bioinformatics and medical data analysis projects. My Python skills include data analysis, machine learning (scikit-learn, PyTorch), and parallel computing (Ray). In R, I'm proficient with Bioconductor for biological data analysis.
I'm also experienced in Linux server management and Bash scripting. I'm familiar with version control (Git), cloud computing (GCP, Azure), and high-performance computing.
Beyond coding, I have skills in NGS analysis workflows, single-cell transcriptomics, and medical informatics, including working with standardized formats like FHIR and SNOMED CT.
During the hackathon, I hope to apply these technical skills alongside my background, particularly for healthcare-focused projects.

> What are your strengths and weaknesses as a team member? What role do you tend to take on in a collaborative setting? *

Strengths:
- My diverse coding skills and domain knowledge in healthcare and biology allow me to contribute significantly to project development.
- My academic research experience helps me approach problems methodically and find innovative solutions.
- I can quickly learn new technologies or concepts as needed for project success.
Weaknesses:
- I sometimes focus too much on details, which can slow progress. I'm working on balancing thoroughness with efficiency.
- While improving, I still find presenting to large groups challenging.

In collaborative settings, I often take on the role of a technical specialist or problem solver. I enjoy diving deep into complex issues and providing interdisciplinary insights. 

> What motivates you to hack, and what do you hope to get out of attending HackMIT? *

My motivation to hack stems from a desire to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.
At HackMIT, I hope to apply my skills to real-world healthcare challenges, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in a short timeframe. This event offers a unique opportunity to collaborate with diverse, like-minded individuals, learning from their perspectives and approaches. I'm particularly excited about the chance to work alongside peers who share my passion for innovation and problem-solving in the healthcare domain.
Moreover, I see HackMIT as a platform to challenge myself creatively and technically. I look forward to stepping out of my comfort zone, tackling novel problems, and exploring innovative solutions that could potentially make a significant impact. 

> Tell us about a project that you're proud of, technical or non-technical! How and what did you learn in the process of working on this project? How did you take advantage of resources around you to make it happen? *

I'm particularly proud of my project, "A machine learning approach using conditional normalizing flow to address extreme class imbalance problems in personal health records," which resulted in a first-authored publication in BioData Mining (https://biodatamining.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13040-024-00366-0).
This project tackled a significant challenge in medical data analysis: extreme class imbalance in personal health records. We developed a novel approach using conditional normalizing flow (CNF), a semi-supervised anomaly detection model, to improve prediction performance in scenarios with very few disease-affected samples.
This interdisciplinary work taught me the value of combining medical domain knowledge with cutting-edge machine learning techniques to address real-world healthcare challenges.

> If you could create any holiday, what would it be?

"Global Digital Detox Day"
This holiday would encourage people to disconnect from digital devices for 24 hours and rediscover the joys of analog experiences. The day would focus on reconnecting with the physical world and appreciating non-digital technologies and activities.
People would be encouraged to write and mail handwritten letters to friends and family, fostering a more personal and thoughtful form of communication. Communities could organize analog game tournaments featuring board games, card games, and outdoor activities, promoting face-to-face interactions and friendly competition.
