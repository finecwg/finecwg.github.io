# Abstract

- MS: multiple sclerosis
  - demyelinating, autoimmune disease ← inflammation of CNS
- stress→MS: ???
- propose that neuropeptides secreted under stress: activate microglia&mast cells
  - CRH, NT(neurotnsin)
- ⇒maturation/activation of T17 autoimmune cells, disruption of BBB, T cell entry into the CNS
- ⇒promote brain inflammation, contributing to MS pathology
- novel therapeutic approach: reduction of stress & inhibition by flavonoids

# Introduction

MS: autoimmune disease ← brain inflammation, demyelination, axonal loss

trigerring factors: infections, toxins, immunizations, trauma, sunlight, hormone...

stress can worsen immunity/brain inflammation → important in the pathogenesis of MS, neuropsychiatric disorders in general

# Correlation between stress and MS

## Human studies

## Animal studies

mouse model: TMEV(Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus) infection

induce EAE: experimental allergic encephalomyelitis

# Involvement of microglia and mast cells

**microglia play an important role in the pathogenesis of MS**

MRP14, 27E10 expressed(acute stage inflammatory macrophage markers) ⇒ intense microglia infiltration in acute MS cases

hypoxia-like lesion existing MS subtype: microglial activation is prominent, precedes T-cell infiltration & demyelination

death by MS → extensive oligodendrocyte apoptosis & microglial activation in the relative absence of T-cells

**Roles of Microglia**

act as antigen-presenting cells for naive T-cells

expanding the number of encephalitogenic Th1 cells

produce glutamate, NO → direct effect on the death of neurons

NO: cytotoxic effect on the endothelium → contribute to BBB disruption

dying oligodendroglial cells: recruit microglia

→ induce contact-dependent oligodendroglial death in the presence of IFN-γ activation

rich source of ROS & various pro-inflammatory cytokineschemokines/proteases

**Role of Microglia in the termination of the inflammatory reaction**

: suppress lymphocyte reactivity through NO release

strong accumulation of CD 163(+) microglia with anti-inflammatory effects was found in acute active MS lesions and at the rim of chronic active lesions

possibly involved in the resolution of the inflammation

phagocytose apoptotic T-cells(seems to be defective in MS)

**in mice with EAE**

microglial activation persists in chronic phase

T cell infiltrates are predominant during the acute phase of the disease

microglia participate in the pathogenesis of EAE: phagocytosing myelin + releasing TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, chemokines

**Th1 and Th2**

Th1 cells, macrophages: brain infiltration

Th2 cells, mast cells: associated with allergic reactions

MS plaque at mast cell reported, could stimulate demyelination directly

# Possible mechanisms to translate stress in MS risk

- actue stress
  permissive effect on MS exacerbation by facilitating BBB breakdown
- chronic stress
  lead to glucocorticoid resistance → immunce cells less responsive to regulatory control by cortisol

## Stress and the HPA axis

Stress → CRH hypothalamic secretion → activate HPA(hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis

→glucocorticoids releasion → suppress immune response

In this context...

may be due to dysfunctional HPA axis because of reduced production of adrenal steroids

patients data is consistent... (absence of a normal cortisol response)

also, glococorticoid resistance development due to stress exposure can be a cause

## Stress, microglia and mast cells

**CRH and NT**

- CRH의 pro-inflammatory effects
  affects brain microvessels directly → activate mast cells → BBB permeability increase
- CRH and NT which are secreted under stress
  synergistically stimulate mast cells → vascular permeability increase, BBB disruption
- NT stimulates mast cell secretion of VEGF(vascular endothelial GF)
  →increase BBB permeability
- NT induce expression of CRHR-1(CRH Receptor-1)

**Stress activates microglia**

- in vivo experiment evidence
- CRH: induce proliferation and TNF-α release in microglia
- microglia express NTR3 → MIP-2, MIP-1, IL-1β, TNF-α
- SP receptors detected: activation lead to the activatio of NF-κB TF
- human - microglia also produce SP → activate mast cells
- microglia respond to pro-inflammatory signals released from mast cells
- mast cell tryptase: induces microglial activation and pro-inflammatory mediator release(TNF-α, IL-6, ROS)

# Conclusion

**treatment?**

- stress-management program
- diazepam, alprazolam
- CRH antagonist

- microglia, mast cell as therapeutic targets? ← no clinically available inhibitors
- natural flavonoids(quercetin, luteolin, apigenin): anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory effects, suppress TNF-α, IL-6 expression and release from microglia, mast cell activation, release of cytokines
  - luteolin, quercetin: decrease myelin phagocytosed by macrophages, reduce EAE
  - luteolin: inhibits mast cell-dependent T cell activation
  - apigenin: sensitizes activated human T cells to apoptosis, inhibits auto-antigen-presenting cells necessary for the expansion and activation of Th17 cells in lupus
  - propolis(flavonoid-containing): inhibits IL-6, TGF-β induced TH17 differentiation in vitro
  - luteolin: inhibit activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and synergistic effect with IFN-β
- luteolin may be reasonable!!
