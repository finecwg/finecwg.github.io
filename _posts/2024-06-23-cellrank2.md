[Figure placeholder - Modular architecture of CellRank 2, adapted from Fig. 1 in the manuscript]

The cornerstone of CellRank 2's flexibility is its modular architecture, which separates the analysis pipeline into two main components:

- **Kernels**: These modules estimate cell-cell transition probabilities from various data types.

## Technical Deep Dive

To fully appreciate the power and flexibility of CellRank 2, let's delve into its technical underpinnings. This section will explore the mathematical framework, kernel-specific algorithms, and estimator functionalities that form the core of CellRank 2.

### 1. Mathematical Framework

At its heart, CellRank 2 uses a Markov chain model to describe cellular dynamics probabilistically. This approach allows for a robust, noise-tolerant representation of cell state transitions.

#### Markov Chain Modeling

In CellRank 2, each cell represents a state in a Markov chain. The transition probabilities between states (cells) are encoded in a transition matrix T ∈ ℝ^(n_c × n_c), where n_c is the number of cells. Each row T_j,: represents the transition probabilities of cell j to its potential descendants.

![alt text](/images/2024-06-23-cellrank2/image-1.png)
[Figure placeholder - Visualization of Markov chain modeling, could be adapted from Fig. 1 in the manuscript]

This probabilistic framework allows CellRank 2 to capture the gradual and noisy nature of fate decisions in biological systems.

### 2. Kernel-Specific Algorithms

CellRank 2 introduces several new kernels, each with its own algorithm for computing transition probabilities. Let's examine the key ones:

#### PseudotimeKernel

This kernel biases a cell-cell similarity graph based on pseudotime values. For cells j and k with pseudotime difference Δt_jk, the edge weight C_jk is updated as:

C_jk = C̃_jk \* f(Δt_jk)

Where C̃_jk is the original similarity-based edge weight, and f is a thresholding function. CellRank 2 offers both soft and hard thresholding options.

#### RealTimeKernel

This kernel combines inter-time point transitions (computed using optimal transport) with intra-time point transitions based on transcriptomic similarity. The global transition matrix T incorporates both:

![alt text](/images/2024-06-23-cellrank2/image-9.png)
[Figure placeholder - Illustration of RealTimeKernel, adapted from Fig. 4a-b in the manuscript]

#### Metabolic Labeling Integration

For metabolic labeling data, CellRank 2 estimates cell-specific transcription (α) and degradation (γ) rates by modeling mRNA dynamics:

ṙ = α - γr

Where r is the mRNA level. Parameters are estimated by minimizing a quadratic loss function across different labeling durations.

### 3. Estimator Functionalities

Once transition probabilities are computed, CellRank 2's estimators perform various analyses:

#### Initial and Terminal State Identification

CellRank 2 uses the generalized Perron cluster cluster analysis (GPCCA) method to identify macrostates from the transition matrix. These are then classified as initial, intermediate, or terminal states.

#### Fate Probability Calculation

Fate probabilities toward terminal states are computed using absorption probabilities in the Markov chain. CellRank 2 introduces a new, faster method for this calculation:

#### Gene Expression Trend Analysis

CellRank 2 enables the visualization of gene expression trends along trajectories and the identification of genes correlated with specific fates. This is achieved by fitting generalized additive models to describe gene expression changes over pseudotime.

![alt text](/images/2024-06-23-cellrank2/image-4.png)
[Figure placeholder - Example of gene expression trend analysis, could be adapted from Fig. 3 in the manuscript]

By combining these sophisticated mathematical techniques with efficient computational implementations, CellRank 2 provides a powerful and flexible framework for analyzing cellular trajectories in diverse biological contexts.
