The rapid integration of machine learning (ML) into healthcare has brought forth a new era of possibilities for patient care and medical research. However, the development of AI in healthcare is not without its challenges. In a recent opinion piece, Yosra Magdi Mekki proposes a novel approach to address these issues: empowering physicians to build their own ML models.

## The Need for a New Collaborative Model

Mekki highlights the communication issues that can arise in teams of doctors and ML experts, emphasizing the need for a new collaborative model in medical AI labs. She argues that expecting every ML expert to have medical knowledge or every physician to be versed in ML is unrealistic. Instead, she advocates for empowering doctors to independently build their own AI models by creating simple, user-friendly frameworks that enable physician autonomy and creativity.

## The Power of User Experience (UX) Design

The true power of AI in healthcare lies in how intuitively and effectively it can be used by healthcare professionals in various settings. Mekki draws a parallel between the evolution of AI in healthcare and the evolution of photography, suggesting that the future lies in doctors using AI toolkits with a focus on application and outcome, much like modern photographers focus on composition rather than camera mechanics.

## The "Spotlight" Approach

Mekki proposes a "spotlight" approach, where machine learners and AI researchers direct resources towards building empowering frameworks rather than single models for specific use cases. The three main components of this approach are:

1. Outcome-focused development
2. Customizable and user-guided AI
3. Modular and accessible design

By focusing on these components, the medical AI industry can create accessible, user-friendly platforms that democratize access to advanced technology for physicians.

## Integrating Real-World Clinical Scenarios

To develop more effective solutions, it is crucial to integrate real-world clinical scenarios in developing and updating algorithms. This requires rethinking the approval process of ML toolkits in clinical settings, considering the increasing use of data augmentation in AI models. Making ML development "easy" allows diverse healthcare professionals to integrate AI solutions that tailor to specific patient populations.

## Bridging the Gap Between AI and Medicine

Professionals with expertise in both medicine and computation play a vital role in bridging the gap between AI and medicine and facilitating the integration of AI into patient care. As AI-literate healthcare professionals, their ethical considerations and professional opinions in tool design help shape future policies, biases, and equitable treatment recommendations.

## Aspect 1. The Importance of Data Accessibility

One crucial aspect of empowering physicians to build their own ML models is ensuring that **relevant data is accessible**. Without access to high-quality, diverse datasets, the development of effective and equitable AI solutions in healthcare will be hindered. It is essential for the medical community to prioritize the release and sharing of data, while maintaining patient privacy and ethical standards, to foster innovation and collaboration in the field of medical AI.

## Aspect 2. The Future of Information Literacy for Physicians

As AI becomes increasingly integrated into healthcare, the role of physicians is likely to evolve. In a world where AI-driven tools and decision support systems are ubiquitous, physicians will need to possess a high level of **information literacy** to effectively utilize these technologies and provide the best possible care to their patients. This raises the question of whether the current specialized and standardized medical education system is sufficient to prepare future physicians for this new reality. Adapting medical education to include AI literacy and hands-on experience with ML tools may be necessary to ensure that physicians can thrive in an AI-driven healthcare landscape.
