## The State of Veterinary Data

Unlike human healthcare, where insurance reimbursement incentivizes structured data capture, most veterinary data is locked away in free text within practice management software. This lack of standardization poses significant challenges for data analysis and integration. However, the landscape is changing, with a growing number of veterinary data sources becoming available, including:

- Electronic medical records
- Imaging data (e.g., radiographs, MRIs)
- Laboratory data
- Genetic data
- Sensor data from wearables

### Electronic Medical Records (EMRs)

- EMRs contain detailed information about a patient's health history, including diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes.
- In veterinary practice, EMRs are typically stored within Practice Information Management Systems (PIMS).
- Unlike human EMRs, veterinary EMRs often lack standardized coding systems, with most information stored as free text.
- Extracting insights from veterinary EMRs requires advanced natural language processing techniques.

### Imaging Data
- Veterinary imaging modalities include radiographs, ultrasound, MRI, and CT scans.
- These images provide valuable information about a patient's anatomy and pathology.
- Most veterinary practices use the DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) standard for storing and transmitting images.
- Advanced image analysis techniques, such as deep learning, can assist with automated diagnosis and segmentation of anatomical structures.

### Laboratory Data
- Laboratory tests, such as blood work, urinalysis, and biopsy results, provide crucial information for diagnosing and monitoring disease.
- In veterinary medicine, laboratory data is often generated by in-house diagnostic equipment or sent to external reference labs.
- Integrating laboratory data with EMRs can provide a more comprehensive view of a patient's health status.
- Standardized coding systems, such as LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes), are beginning to be adopted in veterinary medicine to facilitate data exchange and analysis.

### Genetic Data
- Genetic testing is increasingly being used in veterinary medicine to diagnose inherited disorders and inform breeding decisions.
- The canine genome was sequenced in 2005, paving the way for advanced genomic research in dogs.
- Several commercial companies now offer genetic testing panels for dogs, covering a wide range of traits and disorders.
- Integrating genetic data with clinical phenotypes can help elucidate the underlying mechanisms of complex diseases and guide precision medicine approaches.

### Sensor Data from Wearables
- Wearable devices, such as collars and harnesses, can continuously monitor a patient's activity, sleep, and vital signs.
- These devices generate large volumes of high-frequency data, which can be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to detect subtle changes in health status.
- Wearable sensors have applications in post-operative monitoring, chronic disease management, and early detection of illnesses.
- As the market for pet wearables continues to grow, these devices will provide an increasingly valuable source of real-world data for veterinary research.

By integrating these diverse data sources, veterinary informatics has the potential to provide a more comprehensive understanding of animal health and disease. However, realizing this potential will require continued efforts to standardize data formats, develop advanced analytical methods, and foster collaboration between veterinary and human health researchers.
